Brent Oil Price Analysis Dashboard
Overview
The Brent Oil Price Analysis Dashboard is an interactive web-based tool designed to assess the impact of major political and economic events on Brent crude oil prices. By leveraging time series models and real-time data, the dashboard supports data-driven decisions in the energy sector. Stakeholders can explore historical trends, correlations, forecasts, and critical event-driven shifts in oil prices.

Business Objective
To empower investors, analysts, and policy makers with actionable insights by identifying and quantifying how global events—such as political decisions, armed conflicts, economic sanctions, and OPEC production policies—affect Brent oil price volatility. The dashboard serves as a strategic tool to anticipate risks and market movements.

Contextual Background
This project is part of a consulting initiative by Birhan Energies, a data-driven consultancy specializing in analytical solutions for the energy sector. The goal is to produce a robust, insightful, and scalable dashboard to help clients navigate complex global energy dynamics using predictive modeling and interactive visual storytelling.

Project Structure & Key Tasks
Task 1: Define Data Analysis Workflow
Objective: Develop a clear, reproducible data analysis pipeline for understanding Brent oil price movements.

Activities:

Document data sources, preprocessing, assumptions, limitations, and processing logic.

Define inputs, outputs, and transformation stages.

Establish communication protocols for sharing results with stakeholders.

Deliverables: Detailed workflow documentation and technical explanation of model assumptions and expected outputs.

Task 2: Model Exploration and Extension
Analyze Brent Oil Prices:

Apply traditional models like ARIMA and GARCH to understand volatility and trends.

Integrate Advanced Models:

Explore and apply Vector Autoregression (VAR) and machine learning techniques like LSTM networks for better forecasting accuracy.

Multivariate Factor Exploration:

Evaluate how macroeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP, inflation, exchange rates), technological trends, and regulatory shifts influence oil pricing.

Scenario Adaptability:

Extend model architecture to other commodities or markets.

Validate generalizability and performance of adapted models.

Task 3: Build Interactive Dashboard
Backend (Flask - Python):

Develop RESTful APIs to serve model results and real-time datasets.

Integrate external data feeds (e.g., geopolitical events, commodity news).

Frontend (React - JavaScript):

Build a dynamic UI for interactive exploration.

Use charting libraries to visualize trends, events, and statistical outputs.

Implement responsive design for accessibility across devices.

Key Features
Historical Analysis: Explore oil price movements over time with annotated event overlays.

Forecasting Engine: Visualize short-term and long-term oil price forecasts using statistical models.

Event Correlation: Identify correlations between events and oil price shocks.

Interactive Filtering: Select date ranges, filter by event categories, and drill down for granular analysis.

Performance Metrics: Display model evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and volatility indicators.

Technologies Used
Backend: Flask (Python), REST APIs

Frontend: React (JavaScript), React Chart.js 2, Recharts

Data Science: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM)

Database: SQLite / PostgreSQL (Specify which is used)
